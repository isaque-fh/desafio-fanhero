# User List Project

This project is a user list application with features for listing, deleting, and registering users. It utilizes [MockiAPI](https://mocki.io/) to generate a simulated API, [RTK Query](https://redux-toolkit.js.org/rtk-query/overview) for API consumption, React with TypeScript for the front-end, Material-UI as the design system, and React Hook Form for form management.
